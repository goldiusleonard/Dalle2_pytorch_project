# Dalle2_pytorch_project

1. Run coco_dataset.py
2. Run vizwiz_dataset.py
3. unzip all the dataset
4. pip install -r requirements.txt and several libraries required
5. Set the parameters in train_dalle2.ipynb or train_dalle2.py (choose one)
6. Run train_dalle2.ipynb or train_dalle2.py (choose one)

Note: If you want to train the model in several datasets, just run the train_dalle2.ipynb or train_dalle2.py several times with different train data path in each run.
